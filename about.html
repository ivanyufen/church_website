						<h3>History of Warsaw International Church</h3>
						<h5>HISTORY PREFACE</h5>
						<p>In June 15th 2014, Warsaw International Church celebrated thirty years of ministry. We have taken the
							challenging step to achieve full financial independence and continue to be a spirit-filled place where
							Christians live out their faith while living in Warsaw. At this stage of WIC's journey, it seemed right that we
							should document some of this development, to assist in the growing of understanding and the appreciation for
							what God has been doing in this place.
							In June of 1999 Pastor Bill Anderson documented the following WIC history. </p>
						<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
						<p>"One of the most memorable worship experiences for me was the Pentecost service about two or maybe three years
							ago. For the reading of the Gospel, then Pastor Bill Anderson had recruited ten or eleven readers who all read
							the same passage-but in their native languages. It was an amazing experience because it gave you a real
							perspective of the "speaking in tongues" of Pentecost, that is, of the diversity and unity of the church of
							Christ. I loved it." (Excerpt from the testimony of one longtime WIC participant.)
							The Warsaw International Church has grown up to be a model and exemplary church for the new millennium: A
							quintessential celebration of diversity of language and culture, an inter-denominational, spiritual oasis
							representing every continent and so many countries, a weekly respite for foreigners and Poles who enjoy
							worshipping in the English language. WIC is not about nationalism, competing theologies or liturgies. Like many
							of the international churches that have sprung up in recent years, its message is simple and inclusive-that
							people of very different backgrounds can worship together in harmony.
							The overwhelming obstacles facing Warsaw International Church (WIC) at its onset were swiftly embraced and
							helped form its essential nature over time. Foreigners wanting to pray in English were, and still are, of
							diverse cultural and religious backgrounds. The pioneers who founded the church did not, and most often, could
							not stay and help it take root. The pace of turnover in expatriate worshippers has always been breathless. As
							one pastor put it, "It is like watching a colorful parade pass by." Still, these apparent weaknesses soon proved
							to be strengths.
							<br>
							In its short life the church has grown from several drops in a bucket to a steady stream in every way, from a
							handful of worshippers to 100-plus active participants, from visiting pastors to permanent pastors, and, perhaps
							most significantly, from being almost fully supported by U.S. churches to now, today, being fully self
							sufficient. The church has a reputation in Warsaw for welcoming diverse people and helping them get
							established-whether they are British, American Mongolian or Nigerian, for instance-a spiritual home away from
							home. Recalls founder David Swartz: "A multi-cultural congregation from all kinds of political, economic, and
							geographic backgrounds gathered together week after week in complete harmony to worship the Lord God and to find
							fellowship with one another. All kinds of satellite groups sprang up: Sunday school, a choir, Bible study,
							dinner groups, and excursions. It was great! I'm sure it still is."
							<br>
							1984: An English-Language Church in Communist Poland
							Warsaw in 1984 was a city on edge. The fact that Martial Law had been lifted the year before made little
							difference in daily life, which was still quite hard, an extremely controlled, censored life marked by surreally
							long lines for very small shops frequently bereft of edible food. Many dissident men and women lived then in
							daily fear of arrest under the strong-arm regime of General Jaruzelski.
							<br>
							Of course there were small joys and a vibrant life inside one's own four walls. As we know now, there was also a
							growing strength in the underground Solidarity movement. And the tragic murder of activist Father Popieluszko in
							October 1984, almost certainly by renegade security police, was to be the beginning of the end of communism in
							Poland.
							It was against this tense and remarkable backdrop, and coincidentally the same month as Popieluszko's seminal
							martyrdom, that the Warsaw International Church had its embryonic beginnings. On October 28, 1984, about 25
							expatriates interested in English-language Protestant services attended the first worship in the less than
							celestial surroundings of the U.S. Embassy cafeteria, and a church was born.
							Early documents show that the nascent church was most notably the work of one man, U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission
							David Swartz. "One reason for founding WIC, clearly, was my own need for religious worship and fellowship,"
							Swartz recalls now. "I spoke Polish fluently but nonetheless found attending services to be less than
							satisfying." Swartz's position at the American Embassy, and the cooperation of his supervisors, allowed several
							likeminded people to meet there. In his professional life, Swartz was causing "great heartburn for Gen.
							Jaruzelski and his team" by continuing to meet with the likes of Solidarity first leader and former President
							Lech Walesa. So Swartz was delicate in his management of the new church: "You can imagine how careful we tried
							to be in organizing WIC and, especially, to limiting our contacts with the local Polish populace. My great
							friend Adam Kuczma of the Polish Methodist church showed great courage in agreeing to preach at our services
							approximately once a month." On those occasions, Swartz met Kuczma at his home and drove the minister to the
							embassy to prevent him from being harassed or detained by Polish security forces. "We made the conscious
							decision to discourage Poles from attending services, because we knew the regime could make problems for them
							and also for us," says Swartz, "particularly when we had to seek the Polish government's support for and
							approval of the posting of the first pastor to WIC in 1986." Fortunately, Swartz was on good terms with the
							chief of protocol at the Foreign Ministry at that time.
							Growing Pains, Growing Glory
							In the fall of 1985, WIC was at its first crossroads. "Either we were going to take a quantum leap by seeking to
							institutionalize ourselves, associate with the National Council of Churches, and get a full-time pastor, or we
							were going to stagnate," remembers Swartz. The church at that time had become overburdened with a constant flow
							of visiting pastors, who, though often inspiring and quite gracious, needed accommodations in homes week after
							week. Finding, recruiting, getting visas for, and housing and feeding the weekly visiting pastors from Western
							Europe had reached its saturation point, and the search for the first full-time pastor was on.
							In part, WIC used the Moscow Chaplaincy as a guiding light. This international church was already thriving even
							under the Iron Curtain and its sustenance from American churches was used as a model for the lifeblood of WIC.
							Perhaps, as in the Moscow case, American churches would pay for their clergy to come to Warsaw if some of the
							expenses of maintaining a pastor-apartment rental and car, for instance-would be borne by the informal
							membership. At a congregational meeting in September 1985, the WIC participants voted to seek to obtain a
							resident pastor.
							WIC's first pastor, The Rev. Greg Seeber of the United Church of Christ, arrived in 1986 straight from Istanbul
							and to much joy. In fact, the National Council of Churches approached a number of denominations and ultimately,
							with the Reformed Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church as well as the UCC formed a consortium to jointly
							sponsor pastors for three-year terms. Pastor Seeber found housing to serve as the parsonage in a renovated attic
							of a two-story house in Mokotów, a modest dwelling that served the pastors until 1994. During his years, members
							donated much of the furniture for the parsonage as they left Warsaw. The overarching goal-even then-was for the
							church to ultimately become self-supporting, although with 20 weekly attendees, it seemed highly unlikely.
							Pastor Seeber's tenure was within the context of huge historical shifts in Poland. By the middle of 1988, there
							were democratic rumblings from the underground. De-legalized but far from dead, Solidarity stirred restlessly as
							strikes rocked the country. In August 1988, Lech Walesa met with Gen. Czesław Kiszczak, and the now famed
							shipyard worker became instrumental in quelling the unrest.
							On February 6, 1989, representatives of the communist government, the opposition and the Roman Catholic Church
							joined in the Round Table Talks, and the dismantling of Communism in Poland had begun. After an unprecedented
							two months of talks, the government agreed to open elections but called for an early vote to throw Solidarity
							off-balance. Still, opposition dissident forces swept all the races. The faces of WIC would change and diversify
							as a result.
							In September 1989, The Rev. Richard E. Lake took over the pastoral duties at WIC, a church that was rapidly
							transforming as more expatriates arrived for the purposes of work and study as Poles tasted freedom for the
							first time since before World War II. His wife, Phyllis Lake, who taught at the American School of Warsaw,
							joined him. Pastor Lake remembers now that "people were meeting in the Assembly Hall of the American Embassy, a
							spot reached by entering through one guarded door of one building, out the back, down a flight of stairs, across
							the parking lot, up more stairs, through a Marine-guarded door, and down more stairs." He adds, "One had to be a
							dedicated Christian to endure these hurdles every Sunday."
							Beginning in May of 1990, according to Pastor Lake, there were visitors in the congregation every Sunday, and
							the numbers grew from about 15 or 20 in 1989 to over 100 by his departure four years later. Most people remained
							in Warsaw for a two- or three-year assignment, others for two to six months. "Very few church members had been
							in Poland more than three years," Lake recalls, "which meant that the turnover of members were very high with
							people new to the city becoming part of the congregation every week."
							By 1991, WIC worship had moved to its current location on Miodowa street, in a building that is the headquarters
							of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland (affiliated with the Lutheran World Federation).
							That move alleviated the difficult access to the U.S. Embassy facilities and provided more space for the growth
							in attendance that occurred at the same time.
							"We followed the Ecumenical Lectionary for the weekly lessons," he recalls. "We adopted a rather smorgasbord
							style of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper by providing a common cup with wine, a common cup with grape juice;
							individual glasses with wine and the same with grape juice. We used a common loaf of bread and wafers. A rather
							amusing annoyance was the selection of hymns for the services. Seldom did we select hymns that everyone knew.
							One Brit sort of kept score. If there were two that he knew, he was happy."
							As democracy and Western-style capitalism hit Warsaw like a small tidal wave, WIC was also gaining resources,
							and a vision beyond itself. It was during this time that consistent charitable efforts to its host country
							became part of its mission, and its longstanding relationship with "The House of the Mother of the Good
							Shepherd," an orphanage in Piaseczno, began. Presently, there are about 50 girl-boarders between 6- and
							18-years-of-age and 40 day-care children from the local village; they come from abusive or simply dysfunctional
							families unable to care for the children. WIC makes regular visits to the orphanages, and plans events,
							especially at holiday time. The WIC connection with the orphanage came about through a personal friendship that
							developed in 1980 between Ruthie Wiewióra (a resident of Poland from 1980 to 1996 and a founding member of WIC)
							and Sister Ziuta. When Sister Ziuta (and others) were able to re-open the orphanage in Piaseczno in 1989, Ruthie
							was a major coordinator of WIC efforts to assist them. Dean Ruehle (WIC member 1994-1999, and Council President
							in 1997 and 1998) says: "To see the joy on the faces of the children from Piaseczno whenever we are together
							brings great joy into my life. It is important for WIC to be able to share our resources with these children and
							to contribute to a brighter future for them. We can never do enough to share God's love with them."
							Pastor Jack Hustad and his wife Helen served from summer 1993 to the summer of 1994 at WIC. Jack's strong and
							humorous preaching, and Helen's gifts of music to the congregation strengthened the lives of many people. They
							were instrumental in significant improvements in housing and furnishing. Pastor Hustad was also the organizer
							for the first Inter-faith Thanksgiving Worship in Warsaw (a uniquely American holiday and worship focus).
							WIC Reaches Adulthood-Fully Self Sufficient
							Pastor Bill Anderson and Terry Anderson, who also taught at the American School here, arrived in the prospering
							self-invention called Warsaw, 1994. The posting was a natural for them: They had stayed in touch with Terry's
							Polish relatives, and visited in 1981 and 1983. They had an intimate interest in the quicksilver changes that
							were taking place, because of family, heritage and curiosity. During Pastor Anderson's tenure, the average size
							of Sunday worship fluctuated within a range of 90 to 120-with less in the summer of course. But beyond
							statistics, the congregation touched and affected many lives during these four years.
							In "Pastor Bill's" words: "My ministry here has been very satisfying. The warmth and energy of the congregation
							have been very enriching to me personally." According to Pastor Anderson, ministering to any congregation of
							this size often challenges a pastor to be a jack-of-all trades-messenger, secretary, driver, and, of course,
							spiritual guide.
							Substantial administrative and social outreach programs developed under Pastor Anderson as well, from the first
							church office on Willowa and an active online involvement with alumni of the church worldwide-Marcey Grigsby
							established "Alumni Connections" in May 1999-to social work with Habitat for Humanity, a soup kitchen and a
							Warsaw Women's Shelter.



							The most significant "official" milestone during this time was the growing nature of WIC's status, both in the
							United States and Poland. WIC is today a not-for-profit corporation in the U.S., which gives the organization
							tax-exempt status as a recipient of charitable contributions. WIC can also issue charitable contribution
							statements which are accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, WIC is registered as a church in
							Poland.
							During those early days, it seemed untenable that the transient, colorful body called WIC could support its own
							pastor. But one of the hallmarks of Pastor Bill Anderson's tenure was the feat of self-sufficiency. In 1996, The
							Church Council formally voted to move toward independence. In 1997, half of the cost of the pastor was
							reimbursed to the founding churches. In 1998, 75% of the pastor's cost was reimbursed. Now, WIC pays for its own
							pastor, and is no longer dependent on any other church for its economic survival.
							One challenge that has not changed through the church's development is the hurdles participants and pastors must
							jump over to develop relationships with the ever-changing congregation. And then when so many leave so suddenly,
							to stay in contact with the families as they traverse new terrain.



							Pastor Anderson said: "Because people are here for a short time, I know that we are often slower than we should
							be to establish contact, encourage participation, and effectively incorporate them into our community of faith.
							On the reverse, that constant change is one of the greatest advantages, as it brings in an ever new flow of
							ideas, talents, and experiences to our congregation." </p>
						<h5>MORE RECENT HISTORY</h5>
						<p>On May 23, l999, Pastor Mark Atkinson was called to serve as the fifth resident Pastor of Warsaw International
							Church. Prior to his arrival in September, Pastor Ralph Carlson and his wife, Helen Carlson, helped the church
							through its summer transition. The Carlson’s blessed us with their calm style and formed a bridge to the
							September l9 arrival of Pastor Mark, his wife Lois Ann, and their three children. Pastor Mark was our first
							minister to have ordination standing with the Presbyterian Church USA.
							Pastor Mark and Lois Ann, who is also ordained, brought vigorous pulpit teaching and uplifting adult Bible study
							to our congregation. After about one year, however, the Church Council discerned that we had overreached
							financially when calling our first minister to be fully funded by us. The larger family required a doubling of
							our housing allowance and significant increases in support costs for three children doing home schooling. In the
							late spring of 2000 it was mutually agreed that Pastor Mark would not serve the third year of his contract as
							the church could not guarantee the original financial terms and the Atkinson family could not accept the
							incertitude of the financial outlook. Pastor Mark resigned and went on to serve the Union Church in Lima, Peru.
							On August 1, 2001 we received Pastor Gene Preston as our interim pastor for one year. Pastor Gene came to us
							after eight years of serving as a pastor in Hong Kong. During their year with us, Pastor Gene and his wife,
							Nancy, were active in initiating groups and studies outside of Sunday worship. Our women's group, WOW, evolved
							from our first women's retreat, a project nurtured by Nancy
							Pastor Kerry Purselle arrived in Warsaw on August 1, 2002. She and her husband, Dick, arrived from Brevard,
							North Carolina. Pastor Kerry is ordained in the United Methodist Church. She is our first female pastor, and she
							is also the first ordained female pastor in Poland to undertake full pastoral duties. Pastor Kerry brings joy
							and enthusiasm to the worship services. She loves music with the children and occasionally brings a puppet for
							the children's message. Dick is a great cook, and together they enjoy feeding both body and soul at gatherings
							in their home.
							Since the spring of 2003, four teams of short-term mission groups from the U.S. have come to work with Pastor
							Kerry and Dick in cooperation with our WIC Outreach Committee, led by Young Osawaru. In February 2004, WIC
							consecrated a new hymnal, "The Chalice Hymnal," for use in our worship services. The hymnals were purchased with
							gifts and named in honor and memory of loved ones.
							During the Advent and Lenten seasons of 2003-2004, the congregation held special worship services at the
							Methodist Church in Konstancin on Sloneczna street.
							In October 2004, Warsaw International Church celebrated twenty years of ministry.

							In 2004, Kerry Purselle headed back to her lovely home and church in Brevard, North Carolina. We were sorry to
							see her and Dick go, but gladly remain in touch.

							On August 1, 2005 Pastor Beth Huwiler became the pastor of WIC, her first international posting. When she flew
							in from the U.S. she was greeted at the airport and manse by a large and enthusiastic welcoming committee of WIC
							members. Pastor Beth ended her mission with WIC in July 2007 and returned home.

							We were blessed to have Gene and Nancy Preston back at WIC for a one-year interim position from July 2007 until
							June 2008. Pastor Gene graced us again with his warmth, leadership, and preaching skills. In the transition
							until our full-time Pastor would arrive, Pastor Liz Wyatt led us in service in the summer of 2008.

							In the autumn of 2008 we opened a new chapter at WIC with our first non-American Pastor. Murray Gow came to
							Warsaw all the way from New Zealand; his wife Margherita, by way of the Ukraine. It was exciting to have a young
							family at WIC again with their two children Jonathan and Maria Alexandra. It was also important that we could
							give the Gow family an opportunity to be closer to cherished and missed relatives in the Ukraine. Their adorable
							children quickly adjusted to life in Poland easily and learned the Polish language quickly. This was a joyful
							time for the congregation. Pastor Gow was most notable for his academic acumen and the Bible studies he held at
							the Manse complete with a wonderful dinner Margherita always prepared. It became a weekly family gathering for
							us all.

							When the Gow’s headed back to New Zealand in 2010, Young Osawaru took over the leadership of WIC. Young has been
							behind the scenes it seems forever and now his time to serve the congregation is an apparent leadership role has
							come.

							In June 15th 2014 we celebrated WIC’s 30th anniversary during a wonderful family picnic in Konstancin. This is a
							time of stability for WIC that we enjoy until today. </p>
						<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
						<p>This quote from one of our pastors summarizes the ongoing spirit of our community of faith: "My memory is that
							we (the participants from all over the world and almost every theological persuasion) made it work. We prayed
							and sang and served mission together. There was a most profound respect and appreciation for the very diverse
							backgrounds and traditions, and a willingness to put one's personal demands for a specific liturgy or hymn or
							style aside for the sake of an ecumenical and international expression of Christian fellowship and mission." -
