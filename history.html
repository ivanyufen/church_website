									"One of the most memorable worship experiences for me was the Pentecost service about two or maybe three
									years
									ago. For the reading of the Gospel, then Pastor Bill Anderson had recruited ten or eleven readers who all
									read
									the same passage-but in their native languages. It was an amazing experience because it gave you a real
									perspective of the "speaking in tongues" of Pentecost, that is, of the diversity and unity of the church of
									Christ. I loved it." (Excerpt from the testimony of one longtime WIC participant.)
									The Warsaw International Church has grown up to be a model and exemplary church for the new millennium: A
									quintessential celebration of diversity of language and culture, an inter-denominational, spiritual oasis
									representing every continent and so many countries, a weekly respite for foreigners and Poles who enjoy
									worshipping in the English language. WIC is not about nationalism, competing theologies or liturgies. Like
									many
									of the international churches that have sprung up in recent years, its message is simple and inclusive-that
									people of very different backgrounds can worship together in harmony.
									The overwhelming obstacles facing Warsaw International Church (WIC) at its onset were swiftly embraced and
									helped form its essential nature over time. Foreigners wanting to pray in English were, and still are, of
									diverse cultural and religious backgrounds. The pioneers who founded the church did not, and most often,
									could
									not stay and help it take root. The pace of turnover in expatriate worshippers has always been breathless. As
									one pastor put it, "It is like watching a colorful parade pass by." Still, these apparent weaknesses soon
									proved
									to be strengths.
									<br>
									In its short life the church has grown from several drops in a bucket to a steady stream in every way, from a
									handful of worshippers to 100-plus active participants, from visiting pastors to permanent pastors, and,
									perhaps
									most significantly, from being almost fully supported by U.S. churches to now, today, being fully self
									sufficient. The church has a reputation in Warsaw for welcoming diverse people and helping them get
									established-whether they are British, American Mongolian or Nigerian, for instance-a spiritual home away from
									home. Recalls founder David Swartz: "A multi-cultural congregation from all kinds of political, economic, and
									geographic backgrounds gathered together week after week in complete harmony to worship the Lord God and to
									find
									fellowship with one another. All kinds of satellite groups sprang up: Sunday school, a choir, Bible study,
									dinner groups, and excursions. It was great! I'm sure it still is."
									<br>
									1984: An English-Language Church in Communist Poland
									Warsaw in 1984 was a city on edge. The fact that Martial Law had been lifted the year before made little
									difference in daily life, which was still quite hard, an extremely controlled, censored life marked by
									surreally
									long lines for very small shops frequently bereft of edible food. Many dissident men and women lived then in
									daily fear of arrest under the strong-arm regime of General Jaruzelski.
									<br>
									Of course there were small joys and a vibrant life inside one's own four walls. As we know now, there was
									also a
									growing strength in the underground Solidarity movement. And the tragic murder of activist Father Popieluszko
									in
									October 1984, almost certainly by renegade security police, was to be the beginning of the end of communism
									in
									Poland.
									It was against this tense and remarkable backdrop, and coincidentally the same month as Popieluszko's seminal
									martyrdom, that the Warsaw International Church had its embryonic beginnings. On October 28, 1984, about 25
									expatriates interested in English-language Protestant services attended the first worship in the less than
									celestial surroundings of the U.S. Embassy cafeteria, and a church was born.
									Early documents show that the nascent church was most notably the work of one man, U.S. Deputy Chief of
									Mission
									David Swartz. "One reason for founding WIC, clearly, was my own need for religious worship and fellowship,"
									Swartz recalls now. "I spoke Polish fluently but nonetheless found attending services to be less than
									satisfying." Swartz's position at the American Embassy, and the cooperation of his supervisors, allowed
									several
									likeminded people to meet there. In his professional life, Swartz was causing "great heartburn for Gen.
									Jaruzelski and his team" by continuing to meet with the likes of Solidarity first leader and former President
									Lech Walesa. So Swartz was delicate in his management of the new church: "You can imagine how careful we
									tried
									to be in organizing WIC and, especially, to limiting our contacts with the local Polish populace. My great
									friend Adam Kuczma of the Polish Methodist church showed great courage in agreeing to preach at our services
									approximately once a month." On those occasions, Swartz met Kuczma at his home and drove the minister to the
									embassy to prevent him from being harassed or detained by Polish security forces. "We made the conscious
									decision to discourage Poles from attending services, because we knew the regime could make problems for them
									and also for us," says Swartz, "particularly when we had to seek the Polish government's support for and
									approval of the posting of the first pastor to WIC in 1986." Fortunately, Swartz was on good terms with the
									chief of protocol at the Foreign Ministry at that time.
									Growing Pains, Growing Glory
									In the fall of 1985, WIC was at its first crossroads. "Either we were going to take a quantum leap by seeking
									to
									institutionalize ourselves, associate with the National Council of Churches, and get a full-time pastor, or
									we
									were going to stagnate," remembers Swartz. The church at that time had become overburdened with a constant
									flow
									of visiting pastors, who, though often inspiring and quite gracious, needed accommodations in homes week
									after
									week. Finding, recruiting, getting visas for, and housing and feeding the weekly visiting pastors from
									Western
									Europe had reached its saturation point, and the search for the first full-time pastor was on.
									In part, WIC used the Moscow Chaplaincy as a guiding light. This international church was already thriving
									even
									under the Iron Curtain and its sustenance from American churches was used as a model for the lifeblood of
									WIC.
									Perhaps, as in the Moscow case, American churches would pay for their clergy to come to Warsaw if some of the
									expenses of maintaining a pastor-apartment rental and car, for instance-would be borne by the informal
									membership. At a congregational meeting in September 1985, the WIC participants voted to seek to obtain a
									resident pastor.
									WIC's first pastor, The Rev. Greg Seeber of the United Church of Christ, arrived in 1986 straight from
									Istanbul
									and to much joy. In fact, the National Council of Churches approached a number of denominations and
									ultimately,
									with the Reformed Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church as well as the UCC formed a consortium to jointly
									sponsor pastors for three-year terms. Pastor Seeber found housing to serve as the parsonage in a renovated
									attic
									of a two-story house in Mokotów, a modest dwelling that served the pastors until 1994. During his years,
									members
									donated much of the furniture for the parsonage as they left Warsaw. The overarching goal-even then-was for
									the
									church to ultimately become self-supporting, although with 20 weekly attendees, it seemed highly unlikely.
									Pastor Seeber's tenure was within the context of huge historical shifts in Poland. By the middle of 1988,
									there
									were democratic rumblings from the underground. De-legalized but far from dead, Solidarity stirred restlessly
									as
									strikes rocked the country. In August 1988, Lech Walesa met with Gen. Czesław Kiszczak, and the now famed
									shipyard worker became instrumental in quelling the unrest.
									On February 6, 1989, representatives of the communist government, the opposition and the Roman Catholic
									Church
									joined in the Round Table Talks, and the dismantling of Communism in Poland had begun. After an unprecedented
									two months of talks, the government agreed to open elections but called for an early vote to throw Solidarity
									off-balance. Still, opposition dissident forces swept all the races. The faces of WIC would change and
									diversify
									as a result.
									In September 1989, The Rev. Richard E. Lake took over the pastoral duties at WIC, a church that was rapidly
									transforming as more expatriates arrived for the purposes of work and study as Poles tasted freedom for the
									first time since before World War II. His wife, Phyllis Lake, who taught at the American School of Warsaw,
									joined him. Pastor Lake remembers now that "people were meeting in the Assembly Hall of the American Embassy,
									a
									spot reached by entering through one guarded door of one building, out the back, down a flight of stairs,
									across
									the parking lot, up more stairs, through a Marine-guarded door, and down more stairs." He adds, "One had to
									be a
									dedicated Christian to endure these hurdles every Sunday."
									Beginning in May of 1990, according to Pastor Lake, there were visitors in the congregation every Sunday, and
									the numbers grew from about 15 or 20 in 1989 to over 100 by his departure four years later. Most people
									remained
									in Warsaw for a two- or three-year assignment, others for two to six months. "Very few church members had
									been
									in Poland more than three years," Lake recalls, "which meant that the turnover of members were very high with
									people new to the city becoming part of the congregation every week."
									By 1991, WIC worship had moved to its current location on Miodowa street, in a building that is the
									headquarters
									of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland (affiliated with the Lutheran World
									Federation).
									That move alleviated the difficult access to the U.S. Embassy facilities and provided more space for the
									growth
									in attendance that occurred at the same time.
									"We followed the Ecumenical Lectionary for the weekly lessons," he recalls. "We adopted a rather smorgasbord
									style of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper by providing a common cup with wine, a common cup with grape
									juice;
									individual glasses with wine and the same with grape juice. We used a common loaf of bread and wafers. A
									rather
									amusing annoyance was the selection of hymns for the services. Seldom did we select hymns that everyone knew.
									One Brit sort of kept score. If there were two that he knew, he was happy."
									As democracy and Western-style capitalism hit Warsaw like a small tidal wave, WIC was also gaining resources,
									and a vision beyond itself. It was during this time that consistent charitable efforts to its host country
									became part of its mission, and its longstanding relationship with "The House of the Mother of the Good
									Shepherd," an orphanage in Piaseczno, began. Presently, there are about 50 girl-boarders between 6- and
									18-years-of-age and 40 day-care children from the local village; they come from abusive or simply
									dysfunctional
									families unable to care for the children. WIC makes regular visits to the orphanages, and plans events,
									especially at holiday time. The WIC connection with the orphanage came about through a personal friendship
									that
									developed in 1980 between Ruthie Wiewióra (a resident of Poland from 1980 to 1996 and a founding member of
									WIC)
									and Sister Ziuta. When Sister Ziuta (and others) were able to re-open the orphanage in Piaseczno in 1989,
									Ruthie
									was a major coordinator of WIC efforts to assist them. Dean Ruehle (WIC member 1994-1999, and Council
									President
									in 1997 and 1998) says: "To see the joy on the faces of the children from Piaseczno whenever we are together
									brings great joy into my life. It is important for WIC to be able to share our resources with these children
									and
									to contribute to a brighter future for them. We can never do enough to share God's love with them."
									Pastor Jack Hustad and his wife Helen served from summer 1993 to the summer of 1994 at WIC. Jack's strong and
									humorous preaching, and Helen's gifts of music to the congregation strengthened the lives of many people.
									They
									were instrumental in significant improvements in housing and furnishing. Pastor Hustad was also the organizer
									for the first Inter-faith Thanksgiving Worship in Warsaw (a uniquely American holiday and worship focus).
									WIC Reaches Adulthood-Fully Self Sufficient
									Pastor Bill Anderson and Terry Anderson, who also taught at the American School here, arrived in the
									prospering
									self-invention called Warsaw, 1994. The posting was a natural for them: They had stayed in touch with Terry's
									Polish relatives, and visited in 1981 and 1983. They had an intimate interest in the quicksilver changes that
									were taking place, because of family, heritage and curiosity. During Pastor Anderson's tenure, the average
									size
									of Sunday worship fluctuated within a range of 90 to 120-with less in the summer of course. But beyond
									statistics, the congregation touched and affected many lives during these four years.
									In "Pastor Bill's" words: "My ministry here has been very satisfying. The warmth and energy of the
									congregation
									have been very enriching to me personally." According to Pastor Anderson, ministering to any congregation of
									this size often challenges a pastor to be a jack-of-all trades-messenger, secretary, driver, and, of course,
									spiritual guide.
									Substantial administrative and social outreach programs developed under Pastor Anderson as well, from the
									first
									church office on Willowa and an active online involvement with alumni of the church worldwide-Marcey Grigsby
									established "Alumni Connections" in May 1999-to social work with Habitat for Humanity, a soup kitchen and a
									Warsaw Women's Shelter.



									The most significant "official" milestone during this time was the growing nature of WIC's status, both in
									the
									United States and Poland. WIC is today a not-for-profit corporation in the U.S., which gives the organization
									tax-exempt status as a recipient of charitable contributions. WIC can also issue charitable contribution
									statements which are accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, WIC is registered as a church in
									Poland.
									During those early days, it seemed untenable that the transient, colorful body called WIC could support its
									own
									pastor. But one of the hallmarks of Pastor Bill Anderson's tenure was the feat of self-sufficiency. In 1996,
									The
									Church Council formally voted to move toward independence. In 1997, half of the cost of the pastor was
									reimbursed to the founding churches. In 1998, 75% of the pastor's cost was reimbursed. Now, WIC pays for its
									own
									pastor, and is no longer dependent on any other church for its economic survival.
									One challenge that has not changed through the church's development is the hurdles participants and pastors
									must
									jump over to develop relationships with the ever-changing congregation. And then when so many leave so
									suddenly,
									to stay in contact with the families as they traverse new terrain.



									Pastor Anderson said: "Because people are here for a short time, I know that we are often slower than we
									should
									be to establish contact, encourage participation, and effectively incorporate them into our community of
									faith.
									On the reverse, that constant change is one of the greatest advantages, as it brings in an ever new flow of
									ideas, talents, and experiences to our congregation."

									On May 23, l999, Pastor Mark Atkinson was called to serve as the fifth resident Pastor of Warsaw
									International
									Church. Prior to his arrival in September, Pastor Ralph Carlson and his wife, Helen Carlson, helped the
									church
									through its summer transition. The Carlson’s blessed us with their calm style and formed a bridge to the
									September l9 arrival of Pastor Mark, his wife Lois Ann, and their three children. Pastor Mark was our first
									minister to have ordination standing with the Presbyterian Church USA.
									Pastor Mark and Lois Ann, who is also ordained, brought vigorous pulpit teaching and uplifting adult Bible
									study
									to our congregation. After about one year, however, the Church Council discerned that we had overreached
									financially when calling our first minister to be fully funded by us. The larger family required a doubling
									of
									our housing allowance and significant increases in support costs for three children doing home schooling. In
									the
									late spring of 2000 it was mutually agreed that Pastor Mark would not serve the third year of his contract as
									the church could not guarantee the original financial terms and the Atkinson family could not accept the
									incertitude of the financial outlook. Pastor Mark resigned and went on to serve the Union Church in Lima,
									Peru.
									On August 1, 2001 we received Pastor Gene Preston as our interim pastor for one year. Pastor Gene came to us
									after eight years of serving as a pastor in Hong Kong. During their year with us, Pastor Gene and his wife,
									Nancy, were active in initiating groups and studies outside of Sunday worship. Our women's group, WOW,
									evolved
									from our first women's retreat, a project nurtured by Nancy
									Pastor Kerry Purselle arrived in Warsaw on August 1, 2002. She and her husband, Dick, arrived from Brevard,
									North Carolina. Pastor Kerry is ordained in the United Methodist Church. She is our first female pastor, and
									she
									is also the first ordained female pastor in Poland to undertake full pastoral duties. Pastor Kerry brings joy
									and enthusiasm to the worship services. She loves music with the children and occasionally brings a puppet
									for
									the children's message. Dick is a great cook, and together they enjoy feeding both body and soul at
									gatherings
									in their home.
									Since the spring of 2003, four teams of short-term mission groups from the U.S. have come to work with Pastor
									Kerry and Dick in cooperation with our WIC Outreach Committee, led by Young Osawaru. In February 2004, WIC
									consecrated a new hymnal, "The Chalice Hymnal," for use in our worship services. The hymnals were purchased
									with
									gifts and named in honor and memory of loved ones.
									During the Advent and Lenten seasons of 2003-2004, the congregation held special worship services at the
									Methodist Church in Konstancin on Sloneczna street.
									In October 2004, Warsaw International Church celebrated twenty years of ministry.

									In 2004, Kerry Purselle headed back to her lovely home and church in Brevard, North Carolina. We were sorry
									to
									see her and Dick go, but gladly remain in touch.

									On August 1, 2005 Pastor Beth Huwiler became the pastor of WIC, her first international posting. When she
									flew
									in from the U.S. she was greeted at the airport and manse by a large and enthusiastic welcoming committee of
									WIC
									members. Pastor Beth ended her mission with WIC in July 2007 and returned home.

									We were blessed to have Gene and Nancy Preston back at WIC for a one-year interim position from July 2007
									until
									June 2008. Pastor Gene graced us again with his warmth, leadership, and preaching skills. In the transition
									until our full-time Pastor would arrive, Pastor Liz Wyatt led us in service in the summer of 2008.

									In the autumn of 2008 we opened a new chapter at WIC with our first non-American Pastor. Murray Gow came to
									Warsaw all the way from New Zealand; his wife Margherita, by way of the Ukraine. It was exciting to have a
									young
									family at WIC again with their two children Jonathan and Maria Alexandra. It was also important that we could
									give the Gow family an opportunity to be closer to cherished and missed relatives in the Ukraine. Their
									adorable
									children quickly adjusted to life in Poland easily and learned the Polish language quickly. This was a joyful
									time for the congregation. Pastor Gow was most notable for his academic acumen and the Bible studies he held
									at
									the Manse complete with a wonderful dinner Margherita always prepared. It became a weekly family gathering
									for
									us all.

									When the Gow’s headed back to New Zealand in 2010, Young Osawaru took over the leadership of WIC. Young has
									been
									behind the scenes it seems forever and now his time to serve the congregation is an apparent leadership role
									has
									come.

									In June 15th 2014 we celebrated WIC’s 30th anniversary during a wonderful family picnic in Konstancin. This
									is a
									time of stability for WIC that we enjoy until today.

						Christ. I loved it." (Excerpt from the testimony of one longtime WIC participant.)
						The Warsaw International Church has grown up to be a model and exemplary church for the new millennium: A
						quintessential celebration of diversity of language and culture, an inter-denominational, spiritual oasis
						representing every continent and so many countries, a weekly respite for foreigners and Poles who enjoy
						worshipping in the English language. WIC is not about nationalism, competing theologies or liturgies. Like many
						of the international churches that have sprung up in recent years, its message is simple and inclusive-that
						people of very different backgrounds can worship together in harmony.
						The overwhelming obstacles facing Warsaw International Church (WIC) at its onset were swiftly embraced and
						helped form its essential nature over time. Foreigners wanting to pray in English were, and still are, of
						diverse cultural and religious backgrounds. The pioneers who founded the church did not, and most often, could
						not stay and help it take root. The pace of turnover in expatriate worshippers has always been breathless. As
						one pastor put it, "It is like watching a colorful parade pass by." Still, these apparent weaknesses soon proved
						to be strengths.
						<br>
						In its short life the church has grown from several drops in a bucket to a steady stream in every way, from a
						handful of worshippers to 100-plus active participants, from visiting pastors to permanent pastors, and, perhaps
						most significantly, from being almost fully supported by U.S. churches to now, today, being fully self
						sufficient. The church has a reputation in Warsaw for welcoming diverse people and helping them get
						established-whether they are British, American Mongolian or Nigerian, for instance-a spiritual home away from
						home. Recalls founder David Swartz: "A multi-cultural congregation from all kinds of political, economic, and
						geographic backgrounds gathered together week after week in complete harmony to worship the Lord God and to find
						fellowship with one another. All kinds of satellite groups sprang up: Sunday school, a choir, Bible study,
						dinner groups, and excursions. It was great! I'm sure it still is."
						<br>
						1984: An English-Language Church in Communist Poland
						Warsaw in 1984 was a city on edge. The fact that Martial Law had been lifted the year before made little
						difference in daily life, which was still quite hard, an extremely controlled, censored life marked by surreally
						long lines for very small shops frequently bereft of edible food. Many dissident men and women lived then in
						daily fear of arrest under the strong-arm regime of General Jaruzelski.
						<br>
						Of course there were small joys and a vibrant life inside one's own four walls. As we know now, there was also a
						growing strength in the underground Solidarity movement. And the tragic murder of activist Father Popieluszko in
						October 1984, almost certainly by renegade security police, was to be the beginning of the end of communism in
						Poland.
						It was against this tense and remarkable backdrop, and coincidentally the same month as Popieluszko's seminal
						martyrdom, that the Warsaw International Church had its embryonic beginnings. On October 28, 1984, about 25
						expatriates interested in English-language Protestant services attended the first worship in the less than
						celestial surroundings of the U.S. Embassy cafeteria, and a church was born.
						Early documents show that the nascent church was most notably the work of one man, U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission
						David Swartz. "One reason for founding WIC, clearly, was my own need for religious worship and fellowship,"
						Swartz recalls now. "I spoke Polish fluently but nonetheless found attending services to be less than
						satisfying." Swartz's position at the American Embassy, and the cooperation of his supervisors, allowed several
						likeminded people to meet there. In his professional life, Swartz was causing "great heartburn for Gen.
						Jaruzelski and his team" by continuing to meet with the likes of Solidarity first leader and former President
						Lech Walesa. So Swartz was delicate in his management of the new church: "You can imagine how careful we tried
						to be in organizing WIC and, especially, to limiting our contacts with the local Polish populace. My great
						friend Adam Kuczma of the Polish Methodist church showed great courage in agreeing to preach at our services
						approximately once a month." On those occasions, Swartz met Kuczma at his home and drove the minister to the
						embassy to prevent him from being harassed or detained by Polish security forces. "We made the conscious
						decision to discourage Poles from attending services, because we knew the regime could make problems for them
						and also for us," says Swartz, "particularly when we had to seek the Polish government's support for and
						approval of the posting of the first pastor to WIC in 1986." Fortunately, Swartz was on good terms with the
						chief of protocol at the Foreign Ministry at that time.
						Growing Pains, Growing Glory
						In the fall of 1985, WIC was at its first crossroads. "Either we were going to take a quantum leap by seeking to
						institutionalize ourselves, associate with the National Council of Churches, and get a full-time pastor, or we
						were going to stagnate," remembers Swartz. The church at that time had become overburdened with a constant flow
						of visiting pastors, who, though often inspiring and quite gracious, needed accommodations in homes week after
						week. Finding, recruiting, getting visas for, and housing and feeding the weekly visiting pastors from Western
						Europe had reached its saturation point, and the search for the first full-time pastor was on.
						In part, WIC used the Moscow Chaplaincy as a guiding light. This international church was already thriving even
						under the Iron Curtain and its sustenance from American churches was used as a model for the lifeblood of WIC.
						Perhaps, as in the Moscow case, American churches would pay for their clergy to come to Warsaw if some of the
						expenses of maintaining a pastor-apartment rental and car, for instance-would be borne by the informal
						membership. At a congregational meeting in September 1985, the WIC participants voted to seek to obtain a
						resident pastor.
						WIC's first pastor, The Rev. Greg Seeber of the United Church of Christ, arrived in 1986 straight from Istanbul
						and to much joy. In fact, the National Council of Churches approached a number of denominations and ultimately,
						with the Reformed Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church as well as the UCC formed a consortium to jointly
						sponsor pastors for three-year terms. Pastor Seeber found housing to serve as the parsonage in a renovated attic
						of a two-story house in Mokotów, a modest dwelling that served the pastors until 1994. During his years, members
						donated much of the furniture for the parsonage as they left Warsaw. The overarching goal-even then-was for the
						church to ultimately become self-supporting, although with 20 weekly attendees, it seemed highly unlikely.
						Pastor Seeber's tenure was within the context of huge historical shifts in Poland. By the middle of 1988, there
						were democratic rumblings from the underground. De-legalized but far from dead, Solidarity stirred restlessly as
						strikes rocked the country. In August 1988, Lech Walesa met with Gen. Czesław Kiszczak, and the now famed
						shipyard worker became instrumental in quelling the unrest.
						On February 6, 1989, representatives of the communist government, the opposition and the Roman Catholic Church
						joined in the Round Table Talks, and the dismantling of Communism in Poland had begun. After an unprecedented
						two months of talks, the government agreed to open elections but called for an early vote to throw Solidarity
						off-balance. Still, opposition dissident forces swept all the races. The faces of WIC would change and diversify
						as a result.
						In September 1989, The Rev. Richard E. Lake took over the pastoral duties at WIC, a church that was rapidly
						transforming as more expatriates arrived for the purposes of work and study as Poles tasted freedom for the
						first time since before World War II. His wife, Phyllis Lake, who taught at the American School of Warsaw,
						joined him. Pastor Lake remembers now that "people were meeting in the Assembly Hall of the American Embassy, a
						spot reached by entering through one guarded door of one building, out the back, down a flight of stairs, across
						the parking lot, up more stairs, through a Marine-guarded door, and down more stairs." He adds, "One had to be a
						dedicated Christian to endure these hurdles every Sunday."
						Beginning in May of 1990, according to Pastor Lake, there were visitors in the congregation every Sunday, and
						the numbers grew from about 15 or 20 in 1989 to over 100 by his departure four years later. Most people remained
						in Warsaw for a two- or three-year assignment, others for two to six months. "Very few church members had been
						in Poland more than three years," Lake recalls, "which meant that the turnover of members were very high with
						people new to the city becoming part of the congregation every week."
						By 1991, WIC worship had moved to its current location on Miodowa street, in a building that is the headquarters
						of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland (affiliated with the Lutheran World Federation).
						That move alleviated the difficult access to the U.S. Embassy facilities and provided more space for the growth
						in attendance that occurred at the same time.
						"We followed the Ecumenical Lectionary for the weekly lessons," he recalls. "We adopted a rather smorgasbord
						style of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper by providing a common cup with wine, a common cup with grape juice;
						individual glasses with wine and the same with grape juice. We used a common loaf of bread and wafers. A rather
						amusing annoyance was the selection of hymns for the services. Seldom did we select hymns that everyone knew.
						One Brit sort of kept score. If there were two that he knew, he was happy."
						As democracy and Western-style capitalism hit Warsaw like a small tidal wave, WIC was also gaining resources,
						and a vision beyond itself. It was during this time that consistent charitable efforts to its host country
						became part of its mission, and its longstanding relationship with "The House of the Mother of the Good
						Shepherd," an orphanage in Piaseczno, began. Presently, there are about 50 girl-boarders between 6- and
						18-years-of-age and 40 day-care children from the local village; they come from abusive or simply dysfunctional
						families unable to care for the children. WIC makes regular visits to the orphanages, and plans events,
						especially at holiday time. The WIC connection with the orphanage came about through a personal friendship that
						developed in 1980 between Ruthie Wiewióra (a resident of Poland from 1980 to 1996 and a founding member of WIC)
						and Sister Ziuta. When Sister Ziuta (and others) were able to re-open the orphanage in Piaseczno in 1989, Ruthie
						was a major coordinator of WIC efforts to assist them. Dean Ruehle (WIC member 1994-1999, and Council President
						in 1997 and 1998) says: "To see the joy on the faces of the children from Piaseczno whenever we are together
						brings great joy into my life. It is important for WIC to be able to share our resources with these children and
						to contribute to a brighter future for them. We can never do enough to share God's love with them."
						Pastor Jack Hustad and his wife Helen served from summer 1993 to the summer of 1994 at WIC. Jack's strong and
						humorous preaching, and Helen's gifts of music to the congregation strengthened the lives of many people. They
						were instrumental in significant improvements in housing and furnishing. Pastor Hustad was also the organizer
						for the first Inter-faith Thanksgiving Worship in Warsaw (a uniquely American holiday and worship focus).
						WIC Reaches Adulthood-Fully Self Sufficient
						Pastor Bill Anderson and Terry Anderson, who also taught at the American School here, arrived in the prospering
						self-invention called Warsaw, 1994. The posting was a natural for them: They had stayed in touch with Terry's
						Polish relatives, and visited in 1981 and 1983. They had an intimate interest in the quicksilver changes that
						were taking place, because of family, heritage and curiosity. During Pastor Anderson's tenure, the average size
						of Sunday worship fluctuated within a range of 90 to 120-with less in the summer of course. But beyond
						statistics, the congregation touched and affected many lives during these four years.
						In "Pastor Bill's" words: "My ministry here has been very satisfying. The warmth and energy of the congregation
						have been very enriching to me personally." According to Pastor Anderson, ministering to any congregation of
						this size often challenges a pastor to be a jack-of-all trades-messenger, secretary, driver, and, of course,
						spiritual guide.
						Substantial administrative and social outreach programs developed under Pastor Anderson as well, from the first
						church office on Willowa and an active online involvement with alumni of the church worldwide-Marcey Grigsby
						established "Alumni Connections" in May 1999-to social work with Habitat for Humanity, a soup kitchen and a
						Warsaw Women's Shelter.



						The most significant "official" milestone during this time was the growing nature of WIC's status, both in the
						United States and Poland. WIC is today a not-for-profit corporation in the U.S., which gives the organization
						tax-exempt status as a recipient of charitable contributions. WIC can also issue charitable contribution
						statements which are accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, WIC is registered as a church in
						Poland.
						During those early days, it seemed untenable that the transient, colorful body called WIC could support its own
						pastor. But one of the hallmarks of Pastor Bill Anderson's tenure was the feat of self-sufficiency. In 1996, The
						Church Council formally voted to move toward independence. In 1997, half of the cost of the pastor was
						reimbursed to the founding churches. In 1998, 75% of the pastor's cost was reimbursed. Now, WIC pays for its own
						pastor, and is no longer dependent on any other church for its economic survival.
						One challenge that has not changed through the church's development is the hurdles participants and pastors must
						jump over to develop relationships with the ever-changing congregation. And then when so many leave so suddenly,
						to stay in contact with the families as they traverse new terrain.



						Pastor Anderson said: "Because people are here for a short time, I know that we are often slower than we should
						be to establish contact, encourage participation, and effectively incorporate them into our community of faith.
						On the reverse, that constant change is one of the greatest advantages, as it brings in an ever new flow of
						ideas, talents, and experiences to our congregation." </p>
					<h5>MORE RECENT HISTORY</h5>
					<p>On May 23, l999, Pastor Mark Atkinson was called to serve as the fifth resident Pastor of Warsaw International
						Church. Prior to his arrival in September, Pastor Ralph Carlson and his wife, Helen Carlson, helped the church
						through its summer transition. The Carlson’s blessed us with their calm style and formed a bridge to the
						September l9 arrival of Pastor Mark, his wife Lois Ann, and their three children. Pastor Mark was our first
						minister to have ordination standing with the Presbyterian Church USA.
						Pastor Mark and Lois Ann, who is also ordained, brought vigorous pulpit teaching and uplifting adult Bible study
						to our congregation. After about one year, however, the Church Council discerned that we had overreached
						financially when calling our first minister to be fully funded by us. The larger family required a doubling of
						our housing allowance and significant increases in support costs for three children doing home schooling. In the
						late spring of 2000 it was mutually agreed that Pastor Mark would not serve the third year of his contract as
						the church could not guarantee the original financial terms and the Atkinson family could not accept the
						incertitude of the financial outlook. Pastor Mark resigned and went on to serve the Union Church in Lima, Peru.
						On August 1, 2001 we received Pastor Gene Preston as our interim pastor for one year. Pastor Gene came to us
						after eight years of serving as a pastor in Hong Kong. During their year with us, Pastor Gene and his wife,
						Nancy, were active in initiating groups and studies outside of Sunday worship. Our women's group, WOW, evolved
						from our first women's retreat, a project nurtured by Nancy
						Pastor Kerry Purselle arrived in Warsaw on August 1, 2002. She and her husband, Dick, arrived from Brevard,
						North Carolina. Pastor Kerry is ordained in the United Methodist Church. She is our first female pastor, and she
						is also the first ordained female pastor in Poland to undertake full pastoral duties. Pastor Kerry brings joy
						and enthusiasm to the worship services. She loves music with the children and occasionally brings a puppet for
						the children's message. Dick is a great cook, and together they enjoy feeding both body and soul at gatherings
						in their home.
						Since the spring of 2003, four teams of short-term mission groups from the U.S. have come to work with Pastor
						Kerry and Dick in cooperation with our WIC Outreach Committee, led by Young Osawaru. In February 2004, WIC
						consecrated a new hymnal, "The Chalice Hymnal," for use in our worship services. The hymnals were purchased with
						gifts and named in honor and memory of loved ones.
						During the Advent and Lenten seasons of 2003-2004, the congregation held special worship services at the
						Methodist Church in Konstancin on Sloneczna street.
						In October 2004, Warsaw International Church celebrated twenty years of ministry.

						In 2004, Kerry Purselle headed back to her lovely home and church in Brevard, North Carolina. We were sorry to
						see her and Dick go, but gladly remain in touch.

						On August 1, 2005 Pastor Beth Huwiler became the pastor of WIC, her first international posting. When she flew
						in from the U.S. she was greeted at the airport and manse by a large and enthusiastic welcoming committee of WIC
						members. Pastor Beth ended her mission with WIC in July 2007 and returned home.

						We were blessed to have Gene and Nancy Preston back at WIC for a one-year interim position from July 2007 until
						June 2008. Pastor Gene graced us again with his warmth, leadership, and preaching skills. In the transition
						until our full-time Pastor would arrive, Pastor Liz Wyatt led us in service in the summer of 2008.

						In the autumn of 2008 we opened a new chapter at WIC with our first non-American Pastor. Murray Gow came to
						Warsaw all the way from New Zealand; his wife Margherita, by way of the Ukraine. It was exciting to have a young
						family at WIC again with their two children Jonathan and Maria Alexandra. It was also important that we could
						give the Gow family an opportunity to be closer to cherished and missed relatives in the Ukraine. Their adorable
						children quickly adjusted to life in Poland easily and learned the Polish language quickly. This was a joyful
						time for the congregation. Pastor Gow was most notable for his academic acumen and the Bible studies he held at
						the Manse complete with a wonderful dinner Margherita always prepared. It became a weekly family gathering for
						us all.

						When the Gow’s headed back to New Zealand in 2010, Young Osawaru took over the leadership of WIC. Young has been
						behind the scenes it seems forever and now his time to serve the congregation is an apparent leadership role has
						come.

						In June 15th 2014 we celebrated WIC’s 30th anniversary during a wonderful family picnic in Konstancin. This is a
						time of stability for WIC that we enjoy until today. </p>
					<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
					<p>This quote from one of our pastors summarizes the ongoing spirit of our community of faith: "My memory is that
						we (the participants from all over the world and almost every theological persuasion) made it work. We prayed
						and sang and served mission together. There was a most profound respect and appreciation for the very diverse
						backgrounds and traditions, and a willingness to put one's personal demands for a specific liturgy or hymn or
						style aside for the sake of an ecumenical and international expression of Christian fellowship and mission." -
